""" Allows to gather and create information about convex hulls. """

@overview

Generate attributes and groups than can be furher used to processing convex hulls. 
It can be useful in situations where convex hulls from multiple branches were merged, by using default Houdini merge SOP, and attributes/groups should be generated for them from scratch or refreshed.

=== User Interface ===

@parameters

Add Hull Count ATT:
    #id: createhullcountattribute
    Create detail attribute called ((hull_id)) that contains information about how many convex hulls were detected.
    
Add Bundle Count ATT:
    #id: createbundleidattribute
    Create detail attribute called ((bundle_id)) that contains information about how many bundles were detected.
    
Add Hull ID Attribute:
    #id: create hullidattribute
    Create primitive attribute called ((hull_id)) that helps identify to which convex hull polygons belongs.
    
GRP Per Hull:
    #id: creategrouppereachhull
    Create group per each detected convex hull, grouping all polygons that particular convex hull contains.
    
    Name: 
        #id: specifyhullgroupname
        Pick partial name of generated groups.
        
GRP Per Bundle:
    #id: creategrouppereachhullbudle
    Create group per each detected convex hull bundle, grouping all convex hulls that particular bundle contains.
    
    Name:
        #id: specifybundlegroupname
        Pick partial name of generated groups.
