""" Allows to gather and create information about convex hulls. """

@overview

This tool is useful for generating attributes and groups than can be furher used to processing convex hulls. 
It can be useful in situations where convex hulls from multiple branches were merged, by using default Houdini merge SOP, and attributes/groups should be generated for them from scratch or refreshed.

=== User Interface ===

User interface contains 3 sections + title area.

TITLE:
    This area, beside showing tool title, is used to show help or error information in some situations, to help guide user.
    It shows also build version number. Small incremental change in build number (for example, v2.0 to v2.1 or v2.5) doesn't brake functionality of the tool. 
    Full build number change (fo example, v1.0 to v2.0) brakes it.
    
MAIN:
    Contains parameters that are fundamental for functionality of the tool.    
    
    ==== Parameters ====          
    - _Create Hull Count Attribute_ - creates detail attribute called ((hull_id)) that contains information about how many convex hulls were detected.
    - _Create Bundle Count Attribute_ - creates detail attribute called ((bundle_id)) that contains information about how many bundles were detected.
    - _Create Hull ID Attribute_ - creates primitive attribute called ((hull_id)) that helps identify to which convex hull polygons belongs.
    - _Group Per Hull_ - creates group per each detected convex hull, grouping all polygons that particular convex hull contains.
        - _Name_ - pick partial name of generated groups. Default names is ((hull_))
    - _Group Per Bundle_ - creates group per each detected convex hull bundle, grouping all convex hulls that particular bundle contains.
        - _Name_ - pick partial name of generated groups. Default names is ((bundle_))    

ADDITIONAL:
    Some additional parameters that can be set. Most of them doesn't have anything common with basic functionality and purpose of the tool.
    Think about this section like if it was post-processing part.
    
    ==== Parameters ==== 
    - _Description_ - additional description displayed bellow node name in network view.
      Can be used to help visualize in network view that some operation (for example part of the model) is starting on this node. 
        - _Clean_ - Cleans message field.
        - _Message_ - Message content that will be displayed below node name in network view.
      
AUTHOR:
    Some information about author of this tool. Contain also link to a video tutorial that explains how to use it.
