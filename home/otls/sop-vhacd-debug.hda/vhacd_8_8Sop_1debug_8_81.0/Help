""" Allows debug generated convex hulls. """

@overview

This tool is useful for debuging and visualizing generated with V-HACD Generate convex hulls.
Only input 0 is required to be connected. Both inputs connected are required only for visualization/debugging of bundles.

Exxamples:

- Explode by Hull ID

- Explode by Bundle ID

@parameters

== Main ==          
Show Hull ID ATT:
    #id: showhullidattribute
    Add random color to each convex hull. Requires ((hull_id)) attribute to be present on incoming geometry.
    
Show Bundle ID ATT: 
    #id: showbundleidattribute
    Add random color to each convex hull bundle. Requires ((bundle_id)) attribute to be present on incoming geometry.
    
Explode Hull ID ATT:
    #id: explodehullid
    Push convex hulls out from the center to create an exploded view. Requires ((hull_id)) attribute to be present on incoming geometry.
    
    Power: 
        #id: explodehullidpower
        Set how much power should be used to pull convex hulls away.
        
Explode Bundle ID ATT:
    #id: explodebundleid 
    Push convex hulls and original geometry out from the center to create an exploded view. Requires ((bundle_id)) attribute to be present on incoming geometry.
    
    Power: 
        #id: explodebundleidpower
        Set how much power should be used to pull convex hulls and original geometry away.
        
    Mode: 
        #id: explodemode
        If second input is connected you can pick what is currently visible when exploding.
        
        All:
            #id: 0
            Both, convex hulls and original geometry are visible, overlayed one over the other.
        
        Convex Hulls:
            #id: 1
            Only convex hulls are visible.
            
        Original Geometry:
            #id: 2
            Only Original geometry is visible.
    
== Additional ==

Cusp Normals:
    #id: cuspnormals
    Sharpen or smooth vertex normals of the geometry.
