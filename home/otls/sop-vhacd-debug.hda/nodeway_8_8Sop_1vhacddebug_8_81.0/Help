""" Allows debug generated convex hulls. """

@overview

This tool is useful for debuging and visualizing generated with V-HACD Generate convex hulls.
Only input 0 is required to be connected. Both inputs connected are required only for visualization/debugging of bundles.

=== User Interface ===

User interface contains 3 sections + title area.

TITLE:
    This area, beside showing tool title, is used to show help or error information in some situations, to help guide user.
    It shows also build version number. Small incremental change in build number (for example, v2.0 to v2.1 or v2.5) doesn't brake functionality of the tool. 
    Full build number change (fo example, v1.0 to v2.0) brakes it.
    
MAIN:
    Contains parameters that are fundamental for functionality of the tool.    
    
    ==== Parameters ====          
    - _Show Hull ID Attribute_ - adds random color to each convex hull. Requires ((hull_id)) attribute to be present on incoming geometry.
    - _Show Bundle ID Attribute_ - adds random color to each convex hull bundle. Requires ((bundle_id)) attribute to be present on incoming geometry.
    - _Explode Hull ID_ - pushes convex hulls out from the center to create an exploded view. Requires ((hull_id)) attribute to be present on incoming geometry.
        - _Power_ - sets how much power should be used to pull convex hulls away.
    - _Explode Bundle ID_ - pushes convex hulls and original geometry out from the center to create an exploded view. Requires ((bundle_id)) attribute to be present on incoming geometry.
        - _Power_ - sets how much power should be used to pull convex hulls and original geometry away.
        - _Mode_ - if second input is connected you can pick what is currently visible when exploding.
            - _All_ - both, convex hulls and original geometry are visible, overlayed one over the other.
            - _Convex Hulls_ - only convex hulls are visible.
            - _Original Geometry_ - only Original geometry is visible.
    

ADDITIONAL:
    Some additional parameters that can be set. Most of them doesn't have anything common with basic functionality and purpose of the tool.
    Think about this section like if it was post-processing part.
    
    ==== Parameters ==== 
    - _Cusp Normals_ - use it to sharpen or smooth vertex normals of the geometry. 
      Useful especially in situations where convex hulls were merged from two different branches and one didn't had normals added, which resulted in ugly looking geometry.
    - _Description_ - additional description displayed bellow node name in network view.
      Can be used to help visualize in network view that some operation (for example part of the model) is starting on this node.   
        - _Clean_ - cleans message field.
        - _Message_ - message content that will be displayed below node name in network view.
