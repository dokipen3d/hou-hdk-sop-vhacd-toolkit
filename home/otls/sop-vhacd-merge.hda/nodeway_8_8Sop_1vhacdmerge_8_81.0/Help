= V-HACD Merge =

""" Allows to merge two branches of V-HACD and update its attributes. """

@overview

This node allows to take two separate branches of V-HACD calculation results, merge them and update produced by them attributes. 
The attributes that can be updated are: ((bundle_id)), ((bundle_count)), ((hull_id)) and ((hull_count))

=== User Interface ===

User interface contains 3 sections + title area.

TITLE:
    This area, beside showing tool title, is used to show help or error information in some situations, to help guide user.
    It shows also build version number. Small incremental change in build number (for example, v2.0 to v2.1 or v2.5) doesn't brake functionality of the tool. 
    Full build number change (fo example, v1.0 to v2.0) brakes it.
    
FILTER:
    You can think about this section like if it was preprocessing part. 
    Its purpose is to specify how incoming geometry will be threated and in what form it will be send to main part of the tool.    
    
    ==== Parameters ====          
    - _Process Mode_ - defines oder of which input will be processed first.
        - _A First_ - geometry and attributes from first pair of inputs will be processed first.
        - _B First_ - geometry and attributes from second pair of inputs will be processed first.       
    

ADDITIONAL:
    Some additional parameters that can be set. Most of them doesn't have anything common with basic functionality and purpose of the tool.
    Think about this section like if it was post-processing part.
    
    ==== Parameters ==== 
    - _Cusp Normals_ - use it to sharpen or smooth vertex normals of the geometry. 
      Useful especially in situations where convex hulls were merged from two different branches and one didn't had normals added, which resulted in ugly looking geometry.
    - _Description_ - additional description displayed bellow node name in network view.
      Can be used to help visualize in network view that some operation (for example part of the model) is starting on this node.   
        - _Clean_ - cleans message field.
        - _Message_ - message content that will be displayed below node name in network view.
